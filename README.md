# MatrixCalculator
Java-based Matrix Calculator that can accept the construction of two matrices and do various manipulations. 

## How to Use:
When prompted enter the number of rows and then the number of columns. Then list the values in each row separated by spaces.
There will then be a prompt to create a second matrix as well.
Transposing and Scalar Multiply can be done on only one matrix while other operations require two.

- Transpose
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
